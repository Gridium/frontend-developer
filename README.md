# Gridium Developer Application - Dylan Ludwick

React.js, es6, HTML and CSS3, with chart.js for some data visualizations.

A couple of alterations to note:

Create-react-app was used for the initial build configuration. The npm scripts have been changed to reflect this.

I renamed index.js to jobData.js, moved it into /src, and added some export statements. I also edited the enumerate function slightly.

Thank you for taking the time to go all of these! This project was a lot of fun.
