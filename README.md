To process the data from Gridium I am using the following:
```
React/React-Router/React-Vis/D3
PUG/SASS/Bootstrap
Babel/Webpack/ES6
Gulp/Jest
```

./public/js/index.js has been moved into source/app/assets/Developer/index.js and slightly changed to adapt ES6 syntax and webpack module loading.

A demo will be viewable at http://66.150.214.52/gridium/ when complete.
