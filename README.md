This project is an example of using React to display some data provided via a simple JS module.
To be a bit more creative than just importing the module and dumping the data out I am using React Router to create a simple single page application that upon visiting (or button click) will generate a random job applicant based on the sample data provided.

React-Vis/Bootstrap are used to style things up and display the data, otherwise React is the main framework to connect all the moving pieces.

To process the data from Gridium I am using the following:
```
React/React-Router/React-Vis
PUG/SASS/Bootstrap/Animate.css/Flat-Ui
Babel/Webpack/ES6
Gulp/Jest
```

./public/js/index.js has been moved into source/app/assets/Developer/index.js and slightly changed to adapt ES6 syntax and webpack module loading.

A demo will be viewable at http://66.150.214.52/gridium/ when complete.

TO DO:
Add Jest tests

Minify/Optimize webpack'd assets
