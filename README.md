# Tohm Judson - Gridium Front-end Developer Application

Job posting for Gridium, as requested by Nick Pleis. 

For ease, this was built using the Angular 1.6.5 via cdn. No installation should be required.

A recent browser, with support for CSS Grid, is prefered for viewing. Chrome (>59), Firefox (>54), Safari (>10.1), Edge (Exprimental with `about:flags → “Enable Unprefixed CSS Grid Layout”`, full support in October release). A fallback is built in for old browsers, but results are not guaranteed.

Live version availble [here](http://tohmjudson.com/playground/gridium/)
